measurements of the top-antitop production cross-section from ATLAS and CMS at 13 TeV were analyzed and combined. First, the uncertainties of each measurement were considered: statistical uncertainties were treated as uncorrelated, 
while systematic and luminosity uncertainties had specified correlations between the different measurements. Using these assumptions, a full covariance matrix was constructed to represent all correlations and variances.

Next, the measurements were combined into a single, more precise result using the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method.
This method calculates optimal weights for each measurement based on the covariance matrix, producing a combined cross-section value with minimal overall uncertainty. 
The result accounts for correlations and ensures the combined estimate is statistically optimal.

Overall, the exercise demonstrates how to properly handle multiple experimental measurements with different uncertainties and correlations, providing a rigorous and precise combined result from several independent datasets.
